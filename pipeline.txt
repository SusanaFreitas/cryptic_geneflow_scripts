## RAD analyses ##


useful paths:
reference genomes > ftp://ftpmrr.unil.ch/AsexGenomeEvol/timema/

1) Remove reads that failed Casava files
	script: removereads.sh

2) Read quality
	script: fastqc.sh

3) Check that the barcode and the RAD cutsite are intact, and demultiplexing of the data.
	script: process_stacks.sh

4) cloneFilter to remove PCR duplicates # I won't need this, since there wasn't a step to mark the PCR duplicates.
	skip this step

5) Alignment : BWA better than bowtie (that leaves mores reads out, but test which is best)
	script: 05-mapreads.sh


	helpful oneliners:
	- repeat the same line 88 times in a file
while read line; do for i in {1..88}; do echo "$line"; done; done < inds.end > file


6) SAMTOOLS: sort, filter only aligned reads and index samples (read groups are added during the bwa alignment)
	script: 06-sortfilter.sh

7) filter MAPQ > 30

8) Call SNPs
